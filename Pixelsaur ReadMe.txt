Our Project will be a small endless runner game.
A three pixel high minion (Abb. 1) will run on a ground and has to avoid
barriers of different height and length, which are spawned randomly on
the ground. There will also be some barriers in the air, which can be avoided
without jumping (because its higher than 3 pixels over the ground) or you
have to crouch.
If you crouch, the minion will shrink one pixel, which will appear in front of
the second pixel (Abb. 2).

The ground (Abb.4), the pixel-minion and the barriers (Abb. 3) will
have different colours, two differentiate between them.

To jump you have to press "W" and to crouch, you have to press "S".
for each jump, the pixel-minion moves up by one pixel to a maximum of 2 and
then it will automatically move to its original position. Crouching works only
once and will be brought into original state after this.
